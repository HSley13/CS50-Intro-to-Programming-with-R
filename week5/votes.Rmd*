## Data Visualization

Here I'm gonna include some _electoral data_ for **Mario** and **his friends.**

### Loading Library

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

### Loading data
```{r}
votes <- utils::read.csv("votes.csv")
```

### Displaying data
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggplot(votes, aes(x = candidate, y = votes)) +
    ggplot2::geom_col(aes(fill = candidate)) + # nolint
    ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_d("Candidate") +
    ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 250)) +
    ggplot2::labs(x = "Candidate", y = "Votes", title = "Election Results") +
    ggplot2::theme_bw()
```

### Conclusion
In the end, Mario received `r votes$votes[1]` votes, Peach received `r votes$votes[2]` votes and Bowser received `r votes$votes[3]` votes. 
The total number of votes was `r sum(votes$votes)`
